**Title**: Development of a cross-platform mobile app with Appcelerator Titanium

In depth description of the internship that I carried out at PastBook (Amsterdam, Netherlands) in 2015. During this experience I developed *My Year Photo Book*, a cross-platform mobile app that allows a user to automatically create a photo book using pictures from his Facebook or Instagram account. The app was really successful (more than 50000 downloads in two months) and it was indispensable for the market of the company.
